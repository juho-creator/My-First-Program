# River-crossing-simulation (TI-BASIC)
This is a Ti 84 program that calculates the angle at which the boat should be launched to cross the river and reach the exact location.
The program had been developed through experimentation in the RiverCrossingChallenge.

HOW IT ALL STARTED 
The idea initially came up to my mind when our physics teacher graded one of our assignments based on the high score from playing the game in River Crossing Lab.
I was playing the game manually for a while, but at one point, I realized the variables (River Width, Boat, Current) were always constant except the values that each variable is storing. 

So I thought...
What if I could plug in River Width, Speed of boat, Speed of river on my Ti-84 Calculator and simply just obtain the launching angle to reach the exact location?
And that's how I came up with my program.
