## River-crossing-simulation (TI-BASIC)
This is a Ti 84 program that calculates the angle at which the boat should be launched to cross the river and reach the exact location.
The program had been developed through experimentation in the RiverCrossingChallenge.

## HOW IT ALL STARTED 
The idea initially came up to my mind when our physics teacher graded one of our assignments based on our high score from playing the game in River Crossing Lab.

I was playing the game manually for a while, but at one point, I realized the variables (River Width, Boat, Current) remained constant except the values of each variables.

So I thought...
What if I could plug in the value of each variables on my Ti-84 Calculator and simply obtain the launching angle to reach the exact location?
Wouldn't that make everything much easier?

And that's how I came up with my program.
