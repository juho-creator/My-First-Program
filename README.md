# Boat Launch Helper (TI-BASIC)
* This Ti-84 calculator program computes the boat's launch angle required to traverse the river and arrive at a precise destination. <br />
* It was created through experimentation within the context of the [RiverCrossingChallenge](http://thephysicsaviary.com/Physics/Programs/Games/RiverCrossingChallenge/).

## Demonstration of the program

## How to use the program
1. **Download**: Get the "Loggers.8xp" program file ([Download Link](https://github.com/juho-creator/Ti84-BoatLaunchHelper/blob/main/Loggers.8xp)).
2. **Load**: Transfer the program onto your TI-84 calculator.
3. **Run**: Execute the program on your calculator.
4. **Input Values**: Enter the values for the following variables in your calculator.
     * `River Width`: Width of the river
     * `Boat`: Speed of the boat
     * `Current`: Speed of the current
     * `Distance`: Horizontal distance to the target destination
5. **Launch**: Initiate the boat launch with the computed angle.

## Project Inception
The project idea came about when our highschool physics teacher used the RiverCrossingChallenge game to grade our assignments.<br />
I got frustrated after playing the game manually for hours. At one point I noticed some unchanging variables in the game that could be used to calculate launch angles using my Ti-84 Calculator, making the manual process much simpler. This led to the creation of my very first program.
